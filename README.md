Da Process (Backend):

- Backend was pretty confusing
- used Bcrypt, Mongoose, Postman, Cors, DOTENV, Express, and jsonwebtoken

Actions you can take:
- Create a User
- Login a User
- Create a Project
- View Projects
- Delete Projects

If you try to view your projects without logging in, YOU DIE!!! (jk, you just won't be able to see them)

Roadmap
- Update Project info
- Create Task
- Update Task
- Delete Task
